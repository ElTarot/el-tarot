* Joakims notes
My intent is to work with Joseph to improve tarot.el.
Here are the things I'd like to do:

** TODO Multiple decks
Initially just the standard deck and a deck consisting of only the
major arcana.


** TODO Multiple spreads
I would like more spreads, the celtic cross to begin with.

** TODO User shuffling after the deck
To simulate shuffling of a deck the user can make a random seed by
wiggling the mouse or whatever.

** TODO graphic spreads
Insert card images in a buffer in the shape of the spread being
used. This shouldn't be too hard if one compromises on the layouts a
bit.

*** TODO allow different card images
I have some home made cards I'd like to use and one can also dowload
card images from Wikipedia. Maybe even Pokemon cards, why not :)

** TODO publish tarot.el to ELPA
The main ELPA repo requires FSF copyright but PD ought to be fine. The
emacs maintainers need to be consulted.
